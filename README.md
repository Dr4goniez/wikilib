# wp-lib-extra
This repository is just a place where I develop gadgets to be used on the Japanese Wikipedia.

However, it includes a function library named `wp-lib-extra`, and it can be used on various Wikimedia projects. For an API documentation, see https://dr4goniez.github.io/wp-lib-extra/index.html.
